I am currently a robotics engineer, mainly engaged in robot system design, robotic arm structural design, robot structural modeling. I have also done some work related to intelligent materials for robots and motion control.

In my daily life, I enjoy camping, playing basketball, swimming, and skiing.

I like folk songs, especially those by Zhao Lei.
